NullCascade's Elder Scrolls Modifications
=============

The files found here are varied between Elder Scroll plugin files (.esp), Script Dragon plugins (.dll-ish, written in C++), Skyrim Script Extender plugins (also C++/Assembly), and whatever else I happen to need. Different related tools are grouped in their own subdirectory.

Script Dragon
-------

Script Dragon, created by Alexander Blade, is a Skyrim engine extender, which allows the use of Skyrim script functions in 3rd party ScriptDragon plugins.

I currently have two plugins:

 * [Dragon Souls to Perk Points](http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2063) - Allows the user to convert those useless late-game dragon souls into precious and rare perk points. Configurable to be as cheap or costly as you desire.
 * Immersive Timescale - Changes the timescale dynamically, based on what situation the player is in.
 * [No Fast Travel](http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2075) - Disables the use of fast travel.
 * Toggle UI - Allows the toggling of the UI with a push of a button.
